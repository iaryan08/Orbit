I want to create a couple website (Do not index it on Google or other search engine.) [
    1. Couple Code / Invite System
        One user generates a private couple code
        Second user joins → permanently binds accounts
        Prevents random logins
    2. Password & Security
        Hash passwords (bcrypt / argon2)
        Add OTP or email verification (even basic)
        Login sessions with JWT + refresh tokens
    3. Role-Based Access
        Only the paired partner can view private content
        Zero public exposure by default
        user can upload profile photo, can change password.
